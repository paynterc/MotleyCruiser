/// Just stuff to do
/************
Fix crew list in inventory screen. It's showing inactive crew.

in scr_loc_generate_cantina, put the npcs into global.people
and store the indexes. Look for more instances of rmm.npcs

bug: npcs keep offering the old slaver quest, even if i already have it.
bug: passengers should not have grievances. at least they shouldn't ask for money.


complete the old slaver quest

fix issue with npcs not giving mission, even if they have an exclaimation mark.

show mission updates. some sort of popup or message like Skyrim

fix the mission_log ui or redo it. It needs to use global.mission_map
look in mission2/_mission_types for data structure

Fix the portraits on popup dialog in space.

Too many pirate ships. impossible to beat three at a time with starter ship.
